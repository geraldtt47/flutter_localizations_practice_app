# Flutter Localization Sample App

## Description
This is a Flutter app that is localized to use English and Afrikaans using Easy Localizations & Provider packages. The app basically allows you to switch Languages inside the app without changing the device locale.

## 3rd Party Services 
We used the following services for this project:
1. translate.google.com - Used to translate English to Afrikaans
2. [Locale Code](https://saimana.com/list-of-country-locale-code/) - Used to find locale code, however you can basically google locale codes

## How to update and add more content 
Inorder to update content you have to update files inside assets/translations/
1. Create a key and provide its value e.g "title": "Localized App" in en-US.json
2. Use same key and provide a translated value e.g "title": "Gelokaliseerde App" in af-ZA.json

Happy Coding!
